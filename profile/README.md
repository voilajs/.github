## Repository Migration Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **This repository has been migrated to the [@voilajsx](https://github.com/voilajsx) organization.**

VoilaJS is a minimalist JavaScript framework with an AI-ready architecture that simplifies app creation by eliminating complexity while embracing modern development patterns. We believe development should be fast, modular, and intelligent to be truly productive, which is why we've built a lightweight yet powerful toolset that provides everything needed for rapid, scalable applications that work seamlessly with AI code generation.
